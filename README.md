### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I can't imagine myself doing anything other than engineering, the beauty of applying science in order to make something useful to humanity is just jaw dropping to me. 

I just graduated from computer engineering , applying computing to solve problems is what I do love the most, particularly when it come to mimic human intelligence through Artificial Intelligence.

I am always pushing myself to the limit:
- I've published my first paper
- I'm an Huawei Certified ICT Associate - Routing & Switching, 
- I'm currently working on Deep Learning project for coral conservation as software engineer
- I was the top 1 of huawei's program: seeds for the future  - 2020 MZ
- I was teacher's Aide of algorithms and operating systems
- I've attended 5th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2 2019), Casablanca, Morocco.

skills: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Algorithms, Python, C and  TensorFlow
